# Development Status and Planning

## Overview
Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows remote language models to:
1. Connect via IP address and port
2. Upload images (automatically saved to data folder)
3. Select neural network models
4. Extract flake quality information from 2D material images

## Development Tasks

### 1. Research & Architecture
- [x] Research MCP (Model Context Protocol) specification and requirements
- [x] Design MCP server architecture for 2D material classification
- [x] Define API endpoints and data flow

### 2. Core Server Implementation
- [x] Create MCP server configuration and setup files
- [x] Implement image upload endpoint for saving to data folder
- [x] Implement model selection and prediction endpoints
- [x] Add network configuration for IP address and port binding

### 3. MCP Integration
- [x] Create MCP tools for remote language model integration
- [x] Implement proper MCP protocol handling
- [ ] Add authentication and security measures

### 4. Testing & Documentation
- [x] Test MCP server with sample remote connections
- [x] Create documentation for MCP server setup and usage
- [x] Update project README with Phase 2 MCP server information

## Technical Requirements

### Server Capabilities
- [x] HTTP server for MCP communication
- [x] Image upload handling (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- [x] Model selection from existing models/ directory
- [x] Real-time prediction responses
- [x] Configurable IP/port binding

### Expected Workflow
1. ✅ Remote LM connects to MCP server at specified IP:port
2. ✅ Remote LM uploads image files via MCP tools
3. ✅ Images are saved to data/ folder with unique identifiers
4. ✅ Remote LM selects model from available options
5. ✅ Server runs prediction and returns flake quality analysis
6. ✅ Results include confidence scores and quality classification

### Integration Points
- [x] Leverage existing `GrapheneClassifier` and model loading infrastructure
- [x] Reuse image preprocessing from `CenterCrop` class
- [x] Maintain compatibility with current model storage structure
- [x] Extend functionality without breaking Phase 1 features

## Success Criteria
- [x] MCP server runs on configurable IP and port
- [x] Remote language models can connect and use tools
- [x] Image upload and storage works reliably
- [x] Model selection and prediction endpoints function correctly
- [x] Full documentation and examples provided

## Current Status

**Phase 2: COMPLETE** - Dual MCP server architecture with HTTP transport support
- ✅ **Traditional HTTP Server**: `mcp_http_server.py` (288 lines)
- ✅ **FastMCP Server**: `mcp_fastmcp_server.py` (88 lines) with HTTP + stdio transport
- ✅ **Unified Launcher**: `start_server.py` with automatic port fallback
- ✅ **Project Cleanup**: Code organization and documentation updates

**Phase 3: IN PROGRESS** - Project organization and structure improvements
- ✅ Moved demo/example files to `examples/` directory
- ✅ Cleaned up outdated test and config files
- ✅ Removed Graphene_Shuwen model (9 models remaining)
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect new structure

## Next Steps (Phase 4+)
- [ ] Add authentication system (OAuth 2.1, API keys)
- [ ] Custom model training interface
- [ ] Production deployment with Docker
- [ ] Database integration for persistent history
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching
- [ ] Model versioning and management
- [ ] Batch processing capabilities
