# Phase 2 Development Plan: MCP Server Implementation

## Overview
Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows remote language models to:
1. Connect via IP address and port
2. Upload images (automatically saved to data folder)
3. Select neural network models
4. Extract flake quality information from 2D material images

## Development Tasks

### 1. Research & Architecture
- [x] Research MCP (Model Context Protocol) specification and requirements
- [x] Design MCP server architecture for 2D material classification
- [x] Define API endpoints and data flow

### 2. Core Server Implementation
- [x] Create MCP server configuration and setup files
- [ ] Implement image upload endpoint for saving to data folder
- [ ] Implement model selection and prediction endpoints
- [ ] Add network configuration for IP address and port binding

### 3. MCP Integration
- [ ] Create MCP tools for remote language model integration
- [ ] Implement proper MCP protocol handling
- [ ] Add authentication and security measures

### 4. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test MCP server with sample remote connections
- [ ] Create documentation for MCP server setup and usage
- [ ] Update project README with Phase 2 MCP server information

## Technical Requirements

### Server Capabilities
- HTTP/WebSocket server for MCP communication
- Image upload handling (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- Model selection from existing models/ directory
- Real-time prediction responses
- Configurable IP/port binding

### Expected Workflow
1. Remote LM connects to MCP server at specified IP:port
2. Remote LM uploads image files via MCP tools
3. Images are saved to data/ folder with unique identifiers
4. Remote LM selects model from available options
5. Server runs prediction and returns flake quality analysis
6. Results include confidence scores and quality classification

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing `GrapheneClassifier` and model loading infrastructure
- Reuse image preprocessing from `CenterCrop` class
- Maintain compatibility with current model storage structure
- Extend functionality without breaking Phase 1 features

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MCP server runs on configurable IP and port
- [ ] Remote language models can connect and use tools
- [ ] Image upload and storage works reliably
- [ ] Model selection and prediction endpoints function correctly
- [ ] Full documentation and examples provided
